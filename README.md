# HLTV-scraper

This extension scrapes HLTV's matches page to display soon to happen matches. It has been made as an exercise and as my first extension. I hope you like it and any suggestions are apreciated.

Built using the Web Scraper made by Adam Schwartz using Cloudflare Workers, which is open-source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/adamschwartz/web.scraper.workers.dev) and in their page: https://web.scraper.workers.dev/.

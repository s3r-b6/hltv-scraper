# HLTV-scraper

This extension scrapes HLTV's matches page to display soon to happen matches. It has been made as an exercise and as my first extension. I hope you like it and any suggestions are apreciated.

Built using the Web Scraper made by Adam Schwartz using Cloudflare Workers, which is open-source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/adamschwartz/web.scraper.workers.dev) and in their page: https://web.scraper.workers.dev/.
Also, special thanks to @lootmarket https://github.com/lootmarket/esport-team-logos/tree/master/csgo for maintaining the repo from where the logos have been taken.

All logos and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.
If you represent the entity that has the rights over a logo and you want that logo removed from this project, open an issue requesting its takedown and I will remove it as soon as possible.
